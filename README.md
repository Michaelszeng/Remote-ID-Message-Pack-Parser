# Remote-ID-Message-Pack-Parser

Basic Scripts to parse Remote ID message packs. For example, turning hex string format into human-readable dictionaries, or detecting whether the hex string contains identifiers that means it's a Remote ID message. The hex string is read in from either a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi receiver (that has detected Remote ID signals from a drone).
